This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

atm, this app functions as a vehicle for presenting artwork collected and..or constructed by myself, and displayed in various contexts within my living space.

## Tron

![Three lightcycles lined up and ready for the race](public/tron/tron-stills_063.jpg)

The first collection of images come from a series of >400 stills I generated from the movie, Tron (1982), a movie I saw in the theater at least 5 times when it was out.

Funny aside, myself and my friends kept getting each of our respective parents to take us all to see the film, so worry not, it wasn't one kid's parents sitting through the film repeatedly (though I'm sure they enjoyed it).

The soundtrack to the construction of this Tron portion of the app comes courtesy of Richie Hawtin and his outstanding 'Decks, Efx & 909' mix from 1999:
